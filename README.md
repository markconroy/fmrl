FMRL (pronounced ephemeral is an attempt to build a social network that does not use a database).

## Aim
To build a (basic) social networking that does not use a database. 

# Objectives
- Create a form that posts a status to a file and adds an entry to it
- List the entries in that form on the website
- Update the page when new statuses are added (automatically, or by a "new statuses available" cta)
- Purge the statuses file every X minutes/hours/days (this is the 'ephemeral' part of the FMRL name)
